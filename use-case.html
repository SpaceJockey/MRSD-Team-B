	On May 30th, 2018 NASA Mission control registered an atmosphere level warning from the Quest Airlock Module onboard the International Space Station. Initial assessment of the atmosphere losses suggested a fault with the airlock control and recycling mechanisms, but additional diagnostics failed to identify an equipment fault. NASA archives recalled a communication satellite collision taking place on a similar inclination in 1978, and it was hypothesized that the ISS may be orbiting near the resulting debris field. This led mission controllers to believe that the module may have suffered an impact event with an untraceable 2-3cm piece of debris. The module was immediately sealed to ensure crew safety.

	Mission control began discussing repair options for the module, agreeing that proximity to the debris field posed an elevated risk to an EVA operation. Additionally, the Canadarm2, often used for transporting tools and astronauts during EVAs, was incapable of being retrofit with the necessary repair equipment from inside the station. It was decided to deploy the newly acquired Space Jockey robot from the smaller experiment airlock onboard the Japanese Experiment Module “Kibo”, near the desired inspection site.

	Mission Cmdr. Jebediah Kerman and his twin brother Bob were tasked to unpack the robot from its storage module and fitted it with a temporary hull sealing device. The roughly ½ meter cubed unit was then prepped, powered up and tested, before being deployed through the undersized experiment airlock aboard Kibo. A path was planned for Space Jockey by the station’s onboard computer and wirelessly transmitted to the robot’s computer, enabling it to navigate to the Quest Airlock Module.

	After two hours of teleoperated inspection tasks, the operating crew found that a small impactor had indeed punctured the prograde side of the airlock module, adjacent to the crew lock. Visual inspection revealed that a 3-inch hole had been torn through the hull’s outer shielding plates, and thermal imaging revealed that a hairline fracture had punctured the inner pressure vessel, leading to the loss of atmosphere from that module. The robot deployed sealing foam to the area as a temporary measure, restoring the module to provisional operating status. A return path was generated and transmitted to the robot, and it returned to Kibo’s experimental airlock for retrieval and storage by the crew members.

	After the robot’s intervention, the crew was able to apply hull sealant to the interior of the pressure vessel, permanently sealing the leak. To complete repairs, replacement shielding plates for the module were included in the next station service mission, and an EVA scheduled for external repairs to mitigate future impact dangers in the area. The use of the space jockey robot provided a critical first step in the repair process, and allowed the station to be fully repaired with a minimum level of danger to the crew.
