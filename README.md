##Repository Usage Guidelines
When a Task is stable to be submitted or demoed, BE SURE to create a new tag at that commit, so we can track back to it. This allows us to pursue extra-credit options without risking the demo
On the appropriate commit, call git tag
    git tag Task1-Demo
or an annotated tag:
    git tag -a Task1-Demo -m 'This is the stable basic demo for the project course Task 1'
