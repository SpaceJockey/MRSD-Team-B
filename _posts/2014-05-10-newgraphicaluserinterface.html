The graphical user interface (GUI) was developed using Python and OpenCV. It shows the user a dim image of the clean world map, the current position of the robotâ€™s feet (blue dots), and the current battery status. Users may issue commands by either right-clicking, which adds a movement waypoint command (red circles), or clicking and dragging to select an inspection region of interest (green circles)
