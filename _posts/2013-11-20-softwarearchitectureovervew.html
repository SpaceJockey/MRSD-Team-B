Pictured below is a high-level diagram of our software architecture for the Space Jockey Robot, depicting the movement of information through ROS nodes and topics in the form of messages. A more detailed description follows below.<br />

<h4>Information Flow Overview</h4>
<ol>
	<li>The user issues commands through the G.U.I which are published to the "sched_command" node</li>
	<li>Two nodes subscribe to "sched_command", the Scheduler and the Gait Generator</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Urgent commands that directly manage the scheduler, such as Halt, Resume, or Clear, are picked up by the Scheduler node</li>
		<li>Commands that command the robot to move to user-defined positions, or perform part of a gait sequence, are picked up by the Gait Generator</li>
		<li>The Gait Generator creates joint trajectories, which are sent to "sched_joints", which is subscribed to by the Scheduler</li>
	</ol>
	<li>The Scheduler queues commands from the Gait Generator, which it issues to "serial_link"</li>
	<li>An Arduino sketch within the Robot acts as a node which subscribes to "serial_link" and receives joint commands from the scheduler</li>
	<li>The Robot publishes its latest pose to the "joint_states" topic</li>
	<li>Both the G.U.I. and Rviz update their respective representations of the robot using information from "joint_states"</li>
</ol>
