Following a series of meetings with Dimi Apostolopoulos, the team has decided to pursue a new robot design that accomplishes mobility through a novel "Inchworm" mechanism. The robot shall be composed of three segments connected to each other by prismatic joints flanked by two revolute joints, all actuated. The robot shall move forward or backward by lifting and placing one segment at a time in sequence, while using dry-adhesive-coated feet to keep the other two segments secured to the hull. The actuated revolute joints on each end-segment will allow the robot to tilt sensors mounted to those segments for surveying its environment. A fifth revolution joint in the center segment will facilitate turning both for mobility and for panning the end-segment sensor arrays. The rough kinematic design follows.

At only 7 degrees of freedom, this system will be considerably less complex than the prior hexapod design in all areas of mechanical, electrical, and control design. A degree of mobility is lost, in that the robot will no longer be able instantly move in any direction, but the new system will allow for much simpler plane transitions and will still be capable of turning its body to achieve mobility in all directions. We're confident this design more elegantly accomplishes the goals of this project, and will also offer a new, novel locomotion paradigm to the field of mobile robotics.
