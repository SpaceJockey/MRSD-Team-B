	One of the first questions we had to answer when refining our robot concept was what is the most effective means for the robot to traverse the spacecraft surface? Our initial concept was to create multi-legged design, as seen below.

	We realized that these mobility systems are overly complicated, and may not provide robust functionality when exposed to the space environment. Instead, we came up with idea of creating inch-worm robot as seen below, which is less complex and more stable.
