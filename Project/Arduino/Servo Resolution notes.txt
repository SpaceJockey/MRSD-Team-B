@ 50 Hz = 204800 cycles/sec
Min = 185 ~= .9 ms
Mid = 307 ~= .15
Max = 430 ~= .21 ms


@300 Hz = 1228800 cycles/sec
"Although the length of the
pulses is reduced in a direct ratio to the higher frequency because the power 
is being turned on/off to the motor more frequently, the motor has more
incentive to turn."

I.E. Should be the same settings exactly...
