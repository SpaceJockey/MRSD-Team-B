	<h3>Brian Boyle</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Role - </b>Software Lead<br />
		<b>Background - </b>B.Sc Computer Science, 6 years experience software development
	</p>
	<p>
		As a software engineer by trade, Brian is most at home in front of a computer, but not so much inside it, evidenced by the lack of pictures to be found of him online. His research and development interests lie in mobile, manipulative robots, particular those operating in space. His past work in robotic software dips into controls, simulation, sensing, and more.
