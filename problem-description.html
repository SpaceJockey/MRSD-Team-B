	The process of space launch and travel is a taxing process for both man and machines. Wear and tear incurred by spacecraft during launch and orbital operations can greatly increase costs by decreasing reliability and reusability. Even under typical operations, ambient hazards such as radiation and micro-meteorites slowly degrade the surfaces and components of spacecraft over time. In some cases, even reasonable wear and tear can lead to loss of life if not detected and addressed, as evidenced by the Space Shuttle Columbia Disaster in 2003. Thus, there is a definite need for spacecraft inspection and repair operations in orbit. The best current solution to this problem is met by astronauts performing Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) or "Spacewalks" to perform manual inspections. This solution is versatile, intelligent, and mobile, but at immense costs and danger to astronauts. Each EVA requires the valuable time of astronauts and technicians, incurs wear and tear on expensive spacesuits, and further consumes energy and the various supplies necessary to the life-support needs of the astronaut. The <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/space-suit6.htm" rel="nofollow">procedure listed here</a> gives a hint as to just how much preparation and procedure goes into merely donning an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), each of which cost approximately $12 million.

	We propose building a small, portable robotic platform capable of traversing the exteriors of spacecraft in orbit, and scanning for visual or thermal abnormalities on the hull. This solution could easily be safer, less expensive, and less time-consuming than astronaut EVA. As time goes on and technology progresses in the fields of sensing, manipulation, and artificial intelligence, robots of this class may someday entirely obviate the need for astronaut EVA to perform craft maintenance.
